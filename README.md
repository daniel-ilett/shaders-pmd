## Overview

This project contains a shader graph for creating a sketching effect that is reminiscent of the art style of Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Rescue Team DX. The effect is made up of an outline shader which uses the classic "flip faces, explode the mesh, render black" trick, and a separate shader which uses a drawing texture to make the object look like it's being sketched. An accompanying tutorial is available on [danielilett.com](https://danielilett.com/2020-10-09-tut5-11-urp-mystery-dungeon/).
